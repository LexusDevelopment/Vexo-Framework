This basically means that YOU MAY REDESTRIBUTE THIS AND CHANGE IT, HOWEVER IF YOU DO CHANGE THE FILE IN SOME WAY,
YOU MUST PUT A NOTICE ABOVE IT SAYING THAT YOU EDITED THIS PART OF THE FILE, AND GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER.
ALL REDESTRIBUTED COPIES MUST CONTAIN THE ABOVE LICENSE AND THIS.
YOU MUST DESCRIBE IN THE TEXT THAT (the original owner) IS THE OWNER OF THIS WORK, AND HAS ALL RIGHTS TO IT.
YOU CAN READ AND LEARN FROM THIS, AND IF THE WORK CONTAINS A NOTICE (text file), YOU MUST INCLUDE WHAT IS IN THAT
NOTICE.

Thanks, Samuel.
